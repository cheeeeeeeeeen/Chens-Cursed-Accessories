Chen's Cursed accessories is a mod that adds accessories to the game which can increase stats a lot more than usual, but they are packed with negative effects as well!

This mod is a Work in Progress, and more will be added soon!

There are currently 11 accessories:
- Beguiling Necklace
- Bleeding Tooth
- Broken Shackles
- Daring Thigh Garter
- Demonic Horns
- Earring Of Desire
- Eye of Vlad
- Ring Of Temptation
- Sash Of The Evil One
- The Nail
- Thorned Choker

All of the accessories are only available through Cheat Sheet or HERO's Mod. They are not yet ready for actual gameplay, but players are free to test!

There is not much information about this mod, but the mod is currently just for fun and practice. I can see a huge potential here, though. So far, not much can be said from this mod except for making accessories that both have a positive effect and a negative effect.

Some of the sprites in this mod are placeholders. If you want to offer your spriting skills, then you can help me! If you also have suggestions, then that will be great.

Join the discord group and we can discuss from there.

Thank you for your time to try this mod and taking interest. Have a nice day!
