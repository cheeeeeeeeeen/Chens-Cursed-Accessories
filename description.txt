Chen's Cursed accessories is a mod that adds accessories to the game which can increase stats a lot more than usual, but they are packed with negative effects as well!

This mod is a Work in Progress, and more will be added soon!

There are currently only 9 accessories:
- Beguiling Necklace
- Bleeding Tooth
- Broken Shackles
- Daring Thigh Garter
- Demonic Horns
- Earring Of Desire
- Ring Of Temptation
- Sash Of The Evil One
- Thorned Choker

All of the accessories are only available through Cheat Sheet or HERO's Mod. They are not yet ready for actual gameplay, but players are free to test!

If you want to know more information about this mod, join my discord group. The mod is currently just for fun and practice, but I can see a huge potential here. So far, not much can be said from this mod except for making accessories that both have a positive effect and a negative effect.

Most of the sprites in this mod are placeholders. If you want to offer your spriting skills, then you can help me! Just join the discord group and we can discuss from there.

Thank you for your time to try this mod and taking interest. Have a nice day!
